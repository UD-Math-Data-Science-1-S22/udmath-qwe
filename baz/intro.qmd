This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

By the way, the equation

$$
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)
$$ {#eq-euler-identity}

is rather cool. When you evaluate @eq-euler-identity at $x=\pi$, it becomes 

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0. 
$$

Python is aware of this fact, too:
```{python}
from numpy import *
exp( 1j*pi )
```
